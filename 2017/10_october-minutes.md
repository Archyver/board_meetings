A/V should be fine.

### Django Girls Tulsa

Went well. 4 sponsors covered the cost plus around $400 of excess.

200 OK 2018 Date: May 18 @ Greadington space at Tulsa Library again.

Tierpoint sponsored as a user group hero this month. We want to highlight this more.

Add linkedin to the buffer account to promote techlahoma to that audience.

Move discussion to fundraising committee and come back next month with a refined corporate ask.

Ava met with Representative Forrest Bennett to show starspace and talk about the techlahoma license plate. Should be an official state license plate in early 2018.

#### User Group Committee

There has been talk about reviewing user groups once a year. Jessica has been working on a new application.

Amanda: before the end of the year, I would like to send out more thank yous to donors and volunteers.

Thank the stream team at thunder plains.

### Committee Roster

Luke: OCNP workshop. Having strong committees stuck out to me as being helpful. This could increase techlahoma engagement from volunteers, including non-tech things (like grant writing, for example).

Ava: Google Form feeding into a spreadsheet.
