## 2017 Tech Hires Proposal

Jesse: Techlahoma has a pipeline with three stages: Teach, Engagement, Apprenticeship. Workshops. Because of our connections being technologists, we have access to high quality teachers. Achievements. Measuring engagement. Gamification of engagement and speaking. Apprenticeship phase. Connecting people with the jobs they want.

Proposal: Way to record all this data. (meetup api). Essentially an achievement system for techlahoma. Gives us a level of measurement we have never had before.

Lucas: Revenue possibility. "recommended donation" when a company hires an apprentice.

Merits, not achievements.

Lucas: Make sure to protect IP for idea to avoid a company using the idea for profit.

Meeting is adjourned at 8:03pm.
