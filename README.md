# Board Meetings
To be as open and transparent as possible with our Techlahoma board meetings, this repo contains the agendas & minutes of meetings.

## How to attend as a board member
We will post a Slack call in the #techlahoma-mgmt channel when the meeting begins. Join the Slack call to attend.

## How to attend as a non-board member
To keep meetings timely, efficient, and productive for board members, Techlahoma board meetings are private. We like to invite non-board members to attend, especially if they are involved with a specific team, committee, or project that the board is actively involved with.

Please ask a [Techlahoma board member](https://www.techlahoma.org/leadership) for an invite to the call.

## This repo
We use this repo for (some) board tasks. We also keep our public agendas & minutes here, dating back to October, 2015. Agendas for board meetings before october 2015 are available upon request.
