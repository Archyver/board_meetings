###Agenda

####Awareness, Tech

Scheduling meetings with Chamber of Commerce / Local Government. / Did 36*N get backing from Tulsa biz+govt? If so, how?
Contacting media outlets like Wichita, KS, Kansas City, KS, and Tulsa, OK. Goal is to raise awareness, support, and financial backing.
Confirming members have access to online services (websites, finances, password managers, accounts, etc)
Get email domains for everyone
Get bios from everyone for the site
Using super-user accounts for easier volunteer integration (helping new leaders gain access to account when current leaders deal with lack of time, moving, or burnout)
New subdomains to set up (including legal.techlahoma.org)
Techlahoma Slack + IRC (block: can't log into irc via PW manager until PC is set up again)
Slack sponsors non-profit accts - just need to send them an application
Heroku/DO needed for Techlahoma Slackin (Devin mentioned helping with this) maybe they'd sponsor a nonprofit?
Volunteers for Techlahoma - how can they help?
Discuss any open issues/pull requests/items from previous meeting

####Finances
Access to Bank of Oklahoma accounts - all board members need to have their own BOK card as well
Finances (costs of pizza, heroku, domains, meetup.com for groups needs to be factored into operating budget)
Board Insurance
Sponsorship/donation drive
Federal Paperwork - budgets for 3 years needed

####Community
Getting community leaders involved (like John Kerber)
200OK in 2016 - can we help/volunteer/donate? Are they curating talks or can we send them the best applications from Thunder Plains?
