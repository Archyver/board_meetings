### May (5/31/15, 5pm, 404)

We'd like to talk about:
1) Other locations for large events,
2) The possibility of a techlahoma rented location for events,
3) The Tuesday Center for Non-Profit classes (what ways we can benefit from the CfNP),
4) Legal board members and perhaps adding community advisers (with non-legal roles),
5) Thunder Plains sponsorship + PDFs.


Might be May's minutes?
