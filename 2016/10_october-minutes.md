### Individual Projects
* Space Program Update (Tommy)
  - the fence is going down this week
  - the restriping may not happen by the grand opening
  - we will have 4x as much parking
  - Jesse and Jon will outfit the space to handle accoustical echoes
  - The groups will not reschedule. So, groups meeting at OBI will stay at OBI until the week of Novemeber 31st or later.
  - Grand Opening is October 28th
  - Tommy and Jon will meet to manage the timeslot reservation
  - There might even be a chance to have a second event space upstairs, complete with A/C, carpet, painted walls
  - Today's event was rough but great
  - Dead Center has an event next month. 1MillionCups will also start meeting. we need to make it not rough.
  - Techlahoma and StarSpace46 agreement. SS will give Techlahoma a $5,000 donation every month. SS now has a 60k tax burden. we'll be documenting the transaction.
  - Tulsa and OKC have been selected for **********************************. will announce together later.
  - tommy and lucas are having breakfast with the mayor, they're going to talk about SS46, techlahoma, the tech community.
  - paycom sponsorship between starspace46 (and techlahoma) - 
    - what they are expecting from ss/tf: 
      - Thunder Plains – we can include 5 tickets this year for your team and list you as a Silver Sponsor of ThunderPlains
      - We will reserve the Event space for Paycom once per month for a morning or afternoon – we need to keep 11:30-1:30 open for user groups but before or after is great. We can put multiple months on the schedule now or schedule it month by month, whatever works out to be easier.
      - User Groups – Pick 5 user groups and you can make opening statements in front of them in October, November and December (our other months are already booked!)
      - Flex Space sponsorship – “camera facing” sponsorship with Paycom’s name large on the back wall of the “bridge”. Whenever we have streaming between coworking spaces (which will be almost all the time during business hours) the Paycom name will be very visible – people all over the country will know you helped us build the space!
  
* Thunder Plains Updates (Vance)
  - danny burrows needs to be contacted about being a thunder plains sponsor
  - vance needs to contact glen to update the TP sponsor t-shirt
  - we’ve spent money already on TP = $5,000 for venue lock in and 3 security guards, TP speaker travel has been paid for, hotels have not yet been paid for, we’ve gotten the projector
  - 
  
* Netsuite (Vance)
  - Netsuite account exists but we've been too busy to begin migrating data into it from less accounting.
  - Netsuite can do some of the expensify features, so we can just use NS
  
* Code for Tulsa (Luke)
  - Met with TU yesterday to start process for [OCAST Internship Grant](https://www.ok.gov/ocast/Programs/Intern_Partnerships_(Intern)/index.html) proposal
  - Code for Tulsa would get a part-time intern (full time in summer) to work on civic coding projects
    - Techlahoma would be the "company"/employer; Luke would be the intern's mentor
  - TU would administer grant and do all the paperwork, and send Code for Tulsa/Techlahoma bi-weekly/monthly bill for intern wages
  - TU has put together [the budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/151bdfPnScKJpQm36EE8Ad0N66hIWCKAmX03q49qwlmg/edit#gid=1756696116), which is open to just board & officers until I hear back from TU that it's okay to be public
  - I made it clear that Techlahoma does not currently have enough budget to pay for an intern ...
    - ... so, I plan to take the TU budget to GKFF, LTFF, TAUW, OII, TechHire, etc. to fund-raise for the rest, to be donated to Techlahoma specifically for this purpose/program

## Other Updates
