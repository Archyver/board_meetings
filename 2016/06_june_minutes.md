## Accounting
We have placed the order for swag. The cups have come in and we are getting them engraved.

We are kicking up the capital campaign.

Jesse: We need better visualization of the accounting for people.

Vance: Netsuite has a nonprofit branch that provides accounting tools and litecms for free. It is not tied to my employment.

Jesse: motion to approve vance the latitude to move from less to netsuite.

The motion passes with no objection.

## Admin Items
Devin: Motion decommission us.techlahoma.org. Jesse seconds.

The motion passes with no objection. Squarespace will replace this.

Create a MVP for a RFID system to report attendence to groups. The value add is to gamify it. This could be used not just at starspace, but at any techlahoma event.

Jonathan presents a slideshow [LINK HERE](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1AfeYjd7ijBmGstquPNYx-0o5jN9kCWd5ULJS4MC7HtQ). Help with food costs.

Ryan moves to approve the motion. Vance seconds.

The motion passes with no objection.

We will also create a techlahoma mailchimp (paid plan). We exceeded the free plan.

Squarespace will also allow us to do a community blog.

Ryan: We have set up a free account on hubspot. Also, techlahoma email addresses.


## Program News

Functional programming group. We would like to encourage user groups to get jordan's to speak. Fourth tuesday of the month (maybe).

The Irregulars. Small group. They would like to participate but do not want our code of conduct. They would like to provide their own and present it to us.

Jesse: Objection to the code of conduct rejection.

Jessica and Devin share this objection. The group seems to overwhelmingly oppose this. There are legal concerns.

### 200OK
Amanda: Made about 4k. TulsaWebDevs should be funded for the rest of the year. Their fundraiser was a success.

### Thunder Plains
Vance: CFP is still open. 81 total talks, 61 speakers. lower than last year, but should still be fine. Really nothing else to report.

Three sponsors: robert half. Strong verbals from compose.io and rollbar. t-shirt sponsorship is gone, half of after party is covered.

Next month or two, pick a hotel. Marriot (closest to the venue) is the front runner.

### DevOps Day Updates
Ryan: Delayed because of starspace delays. Maybe in september after coworking opens.

### Job Board
Vance: super busy because of work. Only thing left is emailing people to put jobs. Ryan will handle this.

### Town Hall
Jesse: attendence was a bit lower than expected but word has spread. I want to have a town hall sometimes before thunder plains.

### Starspace Updates
Tommy: Capital campaign has started. Interview with The Oklahoman. Interest from several parties trickling in. I think we are on a healthy track.

New dates: Labor Day Launch. Soft launch a bit before.

Big open house if capital campaign is successful july 28th. Soft cutoff date for fundraiser on july 22nd.

Ryan: pending on capital campaign. donation site needs to be updated with capital campaign option.

### Reboot the fundraising committee
Lucas: Not sure how we want to do it. Re-energize the committee for the capital campaign, whether it means bringing in new people or training existing people to make asks. Coordination of conference funding.

### App idea
We need more information but we would like him to present his idea.

### Email updates.
Ryan: We need to reconize the companies who are giving us 'for nonprofits pricing'.

### Donor Stewardship
Mike: The easiest way to lose a donor is to not thank them. "Seven Thank You"s

1. Immediate note
2. phone call
3. personal note
4. annual report - email
  - annual report should not ask for money. dillutes your asks and dillutes your report.
5. delivery of swag - in person
6. website
7. event shout out

Salesforce nonprofit starter kit. (Tommy: Better than hubspot). Ryan volunteers. Lucas volunteers harder. Lucas wins.

Renewing 80-90% of donors next year for the annual campaign.

Mike: I have never worked with a non profit as small as you that do as much as you as well as you.
