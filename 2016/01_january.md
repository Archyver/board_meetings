* Revisit ear-marked donations [Discussion](https://github.com/techlahoma/techlahoma_donations/issues/10)
  * With one of the goals of Techlahoma being to make it possible to
    fund groups that may not have the means to solicit donations
    themselves it seems like if we allow ear-marked donations that we
    might quickly run into a situation where we can no longer fund
    groups that don't have donations being ear-marked directly for them.
