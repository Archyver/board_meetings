* Propsal to investigate a better, more reliable video chat service.
* Accounting (Luke/Jesse)
* CONSIDER: Can we add Techlahoma debit card to Code for Tulsa AWS account?
   - CfT has $5,000 of AWS credit and spends <$10 per month right now, so no charges expected thru Feb '18, when CfA credits expire
   - But the account is required to have a "back-up" funding source
   - Related: The discussion below about dnsimple.com & paying for domains for Techlahoma groups
* Paying Prototek Update

## Programs

### Individual Projects
* Space Program Update (Tommy)
* Thunder Plains Updates (Vance)
  - Tito (jesse)
  - Buffer (jesse)
  - Video (Jesse)
* Finances Update (Jesse)
* Code for Tulsa (Luke)
  - Met with TU yesterday to start process for [OCAST Internship Grant](https://www.ok.gov/ocast/Programs/Intern_Partnerships_(Intern)/index.html) proposal
  - Code for Tulsa would get a part-time intern (full time in summer) to work on civic coding projects
    - Techlahoma would be the "company"/employer; Luke would be the intern's mentor
  - TU would administer grant and do all the paperwork, and send Code for Tulsa/Techlahoma bi-weekly/monthly bill for intern wages
  - TU has put together [the budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/151bdfPnScKJpQm36EE8Ad0N66hIWCKAmX03q49qwlmg/edit#gid=1756696116), which is open to just board & officers until I hear back from TU that it's okay to be public
  - I made it clear that Techlahoma does not currently have enough budget to pay for an intern ...
    - ... so, I plan to take the TU budget to GKFF, LTFF, TAUW, OII, TechHire, etc. to fund-raise for the rest, to be donated to Techlahoma specifically for this purpose/program

## Other Updates
* User Group On-Boarding Package Update (Jessica)
  - Started https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups
  - Current outstanding user group applications: https://goo.gl/eXE7iB
  - Emails for user groups
    - May we offer techlahoma emails to user groups?
      - Pros:
        - Help keep UG leaders' personal emails private
        - Have access to abandoned UG email accounts that may develop overtime--useful to pass on to new leadership where available.
      - Cons:
        - Another thing to setup and inventory (I expect the hassle to be minor and worth it in the long term)
  - DNSimple
    - Only own techlahoma.com and techlahoma.org
    - Are we going to provide domains for user groups? 
  - Meetup.com Update
    - Unlimited subscription plans allows our meetup groups to have unlimited co-organizers and members but it doesn't allow our account to be organizer of more than 3 groups
      - This means we're limited to reimbursing user group leaders for their Meetup accounts which cover up to two user groups that we might not be sponsoring.
      - There is an option that will allow us to be organizer of additional user groups and it costs us $10 per additional meetup group per month.

        - spreadsheet showing my math: http://goo.gl/d6uvp7
     - Jesse and Jessica have a phone call scheduled with Meetup on 09/26 at 1:30 pm to learn about their [Meetup Pro plan](http://www.meetup.com/pro/)
     - Luke accidentally already had a phone call with Meetup (apparently I scheduled this months ago and forgot?)
        - Everything they said lines up with what Jessica put in the spreadsheet; I added a comment
* OK Coders + Techlahoma SurveyMonkey Survey (Luke)
   - SurveyMonkey un-responsive about Pro account for non-profit :(
   - Anyone have another survey platform we might like for Techlahoma? Just Google Forms?
      - "Skip Logic" is the feature I'm after
* Tulsa Public Schools Partners in Education (Luke)
   - Signed Techlahoma up for STEM support. E.g., showing students coding and speaking to students about coding careers
   - Planning to tell TRSA Techlahoma (Tulsa) volunteers can do 4th Fridays @ 3pm-4pm
   - I'll start recruiting volunteers
* Expensify exploration for group leaders to submit expense reports (Luke)
   - $9/mo./user
     - Single expensers@techlahoma.org account shared via LastPass?
   - Reports (with custom required fields like 'Program')
     - Categories (Food/Meals, Alcohol, Travel, etc.)
     - Tags (Tulsa, TulsaWebDevs, etc.)
   - NetSuite integration
