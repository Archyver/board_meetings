## Other Updates
* User Group On-Boarding Package Update (Jessica)
  - Started https://github.com/techlahoma/user-groups
  - Current outstanding user group applications: https://goo.gl/eXE7iB
  - Emails for user groups
    - May we offer techlahoma emails to user groups?
      - Pros:
        - Help keep UG leaders' personal emails private
        - Have access to abandoned UG email accounts that may develop overtime--useful to pass on to new leadership where available.
      - Cons:
        - Another thing to setup and inventory (I expect the hassle to be minor and worth it in the long term)
  - DNSimple
    - Only own techlahoma.com and techlahoma.org
    - Are we going to provide domains for user groups? 
  - Meetup.com Update
    - Unlimited subscription plans allows our meetup groups to have unlimited co-organizers and members but it doesn't allow our account to be organizer of more than 3 groups
      - This means we're limited to reimbursing user group leaders for their Meetup accounts which cover up to two user groups that we might not be sponsoring.
      - There is an option that will allow us to be organizer of additional user groups and it costs us $10 per additional meetup group per month.

        - spreadsheet showing my math: http://goo.gl/d6uvp7
     - Jesse and Jessica have a phone call scheduled with Meetup on 09/26 at 1:30 pm to learn about their [Meetup Pro plan](http://www.meetup.com/pro/)
     - Luke accidentally already had a phone call with Meetup (apparently I scheduled this months ago and forgot?)
        - Everything they said lines up with what Jessica put in the spreadsheet; I added a comment
* OK Coders + Techlahoma SurveyMonkey Survey (Luke)
   - SurveyMonkey un-responsive about Pro account for non-profit :(
   - Anyone have another survey platform we might like for Techlahoma? Just Google Forms?
      - "Skip Logic" is the feature I'm after
* Tulsa Public Schools Partners in Education (Luke)
   - Signed Techlahoma up for STEM support. E.g., showing students coding and speaking to students about coding careers
