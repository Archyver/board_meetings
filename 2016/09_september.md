## Other Updates
* Meetup.com Update (Jessica)
  - Unlimited subscription plans allows our meetup groups to have unlimited co-organizers and members but it doesn't allow our account to be organizer of more than 3 groups
    - This means we're limited to reimbursing user group leaders for their Meetup accounts which cover up to two user groups that we might not be sponsoring.
    - There is an option that will allow us to be organizer of additional user groups and it costs us $10 per additional meetup group per month.
