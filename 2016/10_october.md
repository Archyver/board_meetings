## Recognition

* We should formally recognize Devin with a proper title/role
  for his work on keeping us organized and on point for meetings
  these last few months. Maybe:
  * Acting Secretary?
  * Historian?

    whole brevity thing.)

## Programs

### Individual Projects
* Space Program Update (Tommy)
* Thunder Plains Updates (Vance)
* Netsuite (Vance)
* Code for Tulsa (Luke)
  - Met with TU yesterday to start process for [OCAST Internship Grant](https://www.ok.gov/ocast/Programs/Intern_Partnerships_(Intern)/index.html) proposal
  - Code for Tulsa would get a part-time intern (full time in summer) to work on civic coding projects
    - Techlahoma would be the "company"/employer; Luke would be the intern's mentor
  - TU would administer grant and do all the paperwork, and send Code for Tulsa/Techlahoma bi-weekly/monthly bill for intern wages
  - TU has put together [the budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/151bdfPnScKJpQm36EE8Ad0N66hIWCKAmX03q49qwlmg/edit#gid=1756696116), which is open to just board & officers until I hear back from TU that it's okay to be public
  - I made it clear that Techlahoma does not currently have enough budget to pay for an intern ...
    - ... so, I plan to take the TU budget to GKFF, LTFF, TAUW, OII, TechHire, etc. to fund-raise for the rest, to be donated to Techlahoma specifically for this purpose/program

## Other Updates
* OK Coders + Techlahoma SurveyMonkey Survey (Luke)
   - SurveyMonkey un-responsive about Pro account for non-profit :(
   - Anyone have another survey platform we might like for Techlahoma? Just Google Forms?
      - "Skip Logic" is the feature I'm after
* Tulsa Public Schools Partners in Education (Luke)
   - Signed Techlahoma up for STEM support. E.g., showing students coding and speaking to students about coding careers
   - Planning to tell TRSA Techlahoma (Tulsa) volunteers can do 4th Fridays @ 3pm-4pm
   - I'll start recruiting volunteers
* Expensify exploration for group leaders to submit expense reports (Luke)
   - $9/mo./user
