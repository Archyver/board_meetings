Twitch:
* Subscriptions - People don't understand how Twitch Prime works or that it gives $5 to Techlahoma per person per month. We need to get the word out about this.
* Planning to train more streaming volunteers soon
* Getting more volunteers signed up to help with highlighting and possibly exporting to YouTube
* Potential opportunities for automating processes
* Premieres - "streaming" pre-recorded videos
  * We hope to schedule the first one soon, possibly next Wednesday.
  * Free Code Camp OKC is considering doing these instead of meetups on the days when She Codes OKC meets because changing the meetup time is confusing.

YouTube:
* People in other states are finding the videos on YouTube and starting to watch the Twitch stream. There might be ways we can reach out more.
* YouTube is a potential revenue stream, but we would need people to work on things like adding keywords and details to video descriptions.

Communication/Documentation:
* Google Form for speakers to let us know whether they're ok with streaming and send information (talk summary and links to slide deck, Twitter, etc.) to post in the chat and video description. This would be totally optional but better than us trying to track the information down.
* GitHub repo for volunteers and speakers to be able to add presentation tips, Twitch highlighting instructions, etc.
* Slack channel for #speakers to share tips

Equipment:
* Might need to replace the HDMI cable. Ideally it would be a little bit longer.
* USB extender for wall clock/timer
* Possibility of using Chromecast to display messages to the speaker on the TV in the back of the room

Help Wanted Board:
* Added several items. Lots of work to do!
* One new volunteer through it so far, but could use more.
