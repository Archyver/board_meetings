1) Huge thanks to Diana Varnes and Matt Williams for launching http://okcourtbot.com/ which is now a central website to get info on courtbot deployments in OK counties. So far we’ve got Tulsa, Rogers, and Muskogee. Coming soon, hopefully: Oklahoma County and more.

2) April 28th statewide launch of the summer meals sites campaign with Hunger Free OK, the OK State Dept. of Ed., and Codesy. https://www.eventbrite.com/e/summer-meals-sites-map-launch-tickets-44238408270  
Please join us at 36°N.
Also feel free to contribute, even if you can’t be there!

3) We’re looking at several areas of civic tech work where we have existing projects, and ideas for new collaboration and new projects:

 — Food Security

 — Criminal Justice

 — Education (examples: TPS Rides, possible project to help look at data, as well as resource referrals (via OpenReferral/211) around chronic absenteeism)

The next step at this point is to do a much better job at organizing, prioritizing, and then documenting these projects so that more volunteers and more organizations, possibly even more cities (Muskogee, Rogers Co., maybe OKC, and others?) can get plugged in.
