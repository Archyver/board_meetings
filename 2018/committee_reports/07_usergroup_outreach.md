* Refresh OKC is starting back up next month and will be renaming to Design Tech OKC.
* Groups needing leaders:

Member Newsletter:
* First newsletter will go out soon.
* Need volunteers to write content for announcements.
* Must manage announcements on a weekly basis so that old content is not included (ex: Django Girls Tulsa).
* Might make more sense for another committee to take responsibility for the newsletter, since it will include more than user groups.
