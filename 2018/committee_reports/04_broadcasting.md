# OKC Broadcasting Committee Updates:

* Scheduling streaming volunteers is going well, and there have been lots of positive comments about the availability and quality of the stream.

* There is interest in simulcasting streams at the OU Innovation Hub in Norman.

* We're falling behind on highlighting Twitch videos and exporting to YouTube but working on getting volunteers together to help.

* 1 Million Cups has been warned again that only trained volunteers should use our streaming equipment.

* We'll work with Richard Mitchell to set up streaming in Tulsa when it's funded. Our current plan is to default to the current Twitch channel and stream to a second Twitch channel when two meetups are at the same time. We'll need to coordinate this between the stream teams and user group leaders.
