# Current Projects:  

- Help Wanted Board Bugs  
- Help Wanted Board is getting a lot of use! (woo-hoo!)  


- Speakers Wanted board  
  - Board to show groups searching for speakers && list of speakers with bios, topics, etc.  
  
# Projects in the pipeline:  
  
- 2019 Usergroup Budgets  

- A means to track Meetup events and their change history in a heroku database 
  - Idea is to use this to track event deletions, rescheduling, and help us better keep our social media automations up-to-date since Meetup and Google Calendar are not a dual connection.  

- React calendar of Meetup events  
  - Help track event state changes  
  - Show an up-to-date calendar of events with filters by city  

- Parse UG application data into a JSON format to port into the application view project
