- 2019 Usergroup Budgets  

- A means to track Meetup events and their change history in a heroku database 
  - Idea is to use this to track event deletions, rescheduling, and help us better keep our social media automations up-to-date since Meetup and Google Calendar are not a dual connection.  

- React calendar of Meetup events  
  - Help track event state changes  
  - Show an up-to-date calendar of events with filters by city  

- Parse UG application data into a JSON format to port into the application view project
