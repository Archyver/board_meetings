# Current Projects:  

- Help Wanted Board  
  - Updating the website to link to it  
  - Issues have been added (woo-hoo!)  
  - Next steps:  
    - Contact form  
    - Advertise board  
  
  - Help Wanted Board issue: No current way to assign people to help wanted issues  
    - A person can be added to the Techlahoma Org and then added to the Help Wanted team, but that's all manual  
    - Could be automated, however that would open us up to adding potential randos to the Techlahoma Org  

- 2019 Usergroup Budgets
  - UG Committee has been discussing a new budgeting system for 2019  
  - Budgeting system would allow Usergroup Leader's to create budgets of what they think their usergroup would need for the year  
  - Usergroup Committee is working with the Treasurer on the new proposal  
  - If someone is interested in weighing in, let Carmen know  
  - When the proposal is complete, we'll submit to the board  
  
# Projects in the pipeline:  

- Speakers Wanted board  
  - Board to show groups searching for speakers && list of speakers with bios, topics, etc.  

- A means to track Meetup events and their change history in a heroku database Idea is to use this to track event deletions, rescheduling, and help us better keep our social media automations up-to-date since Meetup and Google Calendar are not a dual connection.  

- React calendar of Meetup events  
  - Help track event state changes  
  - Show an up-to-date calendar of events with filters by city  

- Parse UG application data into a JSON format to port into the application view project
