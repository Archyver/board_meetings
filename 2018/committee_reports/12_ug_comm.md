# User Group Recommendations 2019:  

- ## UG Comm recommends not approving:  

  - Goodwill's TulsaWORKS Career Academy  
    
    We recommend partnering with this organization in other ways. It seems like a really worthy cause and in line with our mission, however they aren't a usergroup. We would like to see Techlahoma partner with them in other ways, but the Usergroup Committee doesn't have the bandwidth to spearhead an effort like that right now.  

- ## Groups who did not re-apply or missing the deadline:  

  - OKC PHP: Didn't reapply  
  - OKC Tableau User Group: Didn't reapply  
  - Tulsa Data Science: Didn't reapply  
  - ~Tulsa Ruby User Group: Missed the deadline~

- ## Groups we recommend with contingency:  

  - Tulsa Computer Systems, Networks, and Science (Sponsored) 
    
    This group fits well within our mission, but the group has only one organizer. UG Comm recommends approval of this group contingent upon the UGL finding a co-org by Feb. 1.  
  
  - ProductTank OKC (Sponsored)  
    
    This group seems to be a good fit and something we are missing within our organization currently (Project Management). However, the meetup description mentions drinking alcohol as a part of their meetups. We need to be sure that this group is aware of our alcohol policy, and removes that from their meetup description.  
  
  - Oklahoma Power BI User Group (Affiliated)
  
    This group did not agree to use meetup.com. They requested to be an affiliated group, and the UG Comm has decided to drop the requirement for affiliated groups to use meetup.com.  
    *However* this means that this group will not be taking part in any of our automated systems, including Twitter. Techlahoma will not be tweeting about them or promoting their events via Twitter.  

- ## New groups we recommend approving:

  - Enid Tech Club (Affiliated)
  - Free Code Camp Tulsa (Affiliated)
  - freeCodeCamp Norman (Sponsored)
  - OKC Indie Hackers (Sponsored)
  - Oklahoma PowerApps and Flow User Group (Affiliated)
  - SheCodesTulsa (Sponsored)
  - Starspace46 Community Stand-up (Affiliated)
  - Tulsa Developers Association (Affiliated)

- ## UG Comm recommends all current groups be approved for 2019  
- ## UG Comm budget request to the treasurer was $33k for 2019  
  - Current budget requests stand at $31,781.50:
    - Food requests: $23,917.50
    - DNSimple: $844
    - Meetup: $7,020
  
  - UG Comm plans to closely review the budget requests and see if there is any room there
