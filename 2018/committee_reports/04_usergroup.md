# General Issues:

  - Trouble finding speakers
    A consistent refrain we are hearing from UG Leads is how they are having trouble finding speakers. Kimberly and Carmen are discussing a "Speakers Wanted" board to help with this.

# Projects in the pipeline:

  - Speakers Wanted board
    Board to show groups searching for speakers && list of speakers with bios, topics, etc.

  - A means to track Meetup events and their change history in a heroku database
    Ideas to use this to track event deletions, rescheduling, and help us better keep our social media automations up-to-date since Meetup and Google Calendar are not a dual connection.

  - React calendar of Meetup events
    Help track event state changes
    Show an up-to-date calendar of events with filters by city

  - Parse UG application data into a JSON format to port into the application view project
