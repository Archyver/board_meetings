## Officer Reports

### Vice President

### Treasurer

## Committee Reports

### Conduct

Ava: Minor slack etiquette stuff. 

### ThunderPlains

Vance: Net Revenue of $49,507. 60/40 profit split with Innotech. Final profit is still being calculated.

### Civic Tech

Carlos: Civic Tech is alive and well. Code for Tulsa is working to find patterns of abuse in the Oklahoma County jail. Contacted ACLU lawyer to work with. 

### Workshop

DjangoGirls told us we have had too many events. The next one is in January. 

### User Group

Kimberly and Carmen have been working on getting everyone to submit user group applications. We are requiring budgets for groups this year.

### Fundraising

~$1300 a month in recurring monthly donations. Main campaign is over. The next step is to build a call list for high value people to ask to donate.

Mike Slack is going to put together a call night to solicit donations. That will finish our campaign for the year.

#### Corporate

Paycom came to ThunderPlains through Lucas and sponsored at the highest package.

#### Grants

Carlos has found a grant that we have a good shot at. It is due January 15th.

### Merchandise

Ava: License plate was approved. We have about 6 months to get 100 signups. It will take about another 6 months for them to come in. We get $40 a year for each plate.

We are going to look into ways to make it easier for people to apply.

### Broadcasting

Kimberly presented a [report](https://github.com/techlahoma/board_meetings/blob/master/2018/committee_reports/11_okc_broadcasting.md).

## Proposals

### Document to send potential board members

This is a great idea. Carlos has agreed to start on it.

## President's Report

Recognizing ThunderPlains volunteers. Good fundraising message we can continue to refine. The biggest thing we can do is more active outreach.
