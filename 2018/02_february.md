## Action Items
- Vote: Amend bylaws to allow any board member to serve as Treasurer (requires 75% vote)
- To fill the empty Treasurer role:
  - Vote: Hope Briggs (bookkeeper who offices at StarSpace46 and keeps books for SS46 and many other companies) to both fill the empty board seat AND the Treasurer role
  - OR
  - Vote for another current board member to fill the Treasurer role (Kendall Werts, Carmen Long, others?)
- Vote: Nominees to fill the empty board seat (depending on outcome of Treasurer vote)


## Proposals
- Filling the Treasurer officer position (with no qualified board members willing to serve, we must decide how to fill this needed office).
  - Confirm again whether or not a qualified boardmember is willing to serve.
  - Some Possible options to consider:
    - Create a finance committee, then appoint this committee to serve as the Treasurer officer. (Finance committee probably a good idea regardless of this approach)
    - Change the Policies surrounding Treasurer officer qualifications to allow new board member to serve as Treasurer.
    - Hire/secure bookkeeper to fulfil key financial portions of duties.

- Discuss action plan for committee goals
- Creating Women Who Code Tulsa as a workshop since it has interested funders.
- Should we participate (sponsorship, booth, official Techlahoma judge/mentor) in OU's Hacklahoma March 3-4, 2018.  [Site](https://hacklahoma.org/). Also, should we investigate further/future partnerships with this org?
- Improve power setup for A/V equipment at StarSpace46. Too many devices are plugged into a single outlet, risking fire or electrical damage. We need a better circuit (quotes for $300-350) and a surge protector (ranging from $120-170).
