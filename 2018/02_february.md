## Action Items


## Proposals
- Filling the Treasurer officer position (with no qualified board members willing to serve, we must decide how to fill this needed office).
  - Confirm again whether or not a qualified boardmember is willing to serve.
  - Some Possible options to consider:
    - Create a finance committee, then appoint this committee to serve as the Treasurer officer. (Finance committee probably a good idea regardless of this approach)
    - Change the Policies surrounding Treasurer officer qualifications to allow new board member to serve as Treasurer.
    - Hire/secure bookkeeper to fulfil key financial portions of duties.
- [Board retreat for strategic planning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SmGH7bqBPcwpEz3zCQ-Lwg7bOhPA8i0iWtp1O-to0vE/edit?usp=sharing) 
- Discuss action plan for committee goals
- Creating Women Who Code Tulsa as a workshop since it has interested funders.
- Should we participate (sponsorship, booth, official Techlahoma judge/mentor) in OU's Hacklahoma March 3-4, 2018.  [Site](https://hacklahoma.org/). Also, should we investigate further/future partnerships with this org?
