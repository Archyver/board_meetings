# 2019-03-19 Content Creation Committee Report

The broadcasting committee has been renamed to Content Creation. We support Techlahoma's Conference, User Group, and Workshop programs by coordinating live streaming and video recording for events.

Report from each [team](https://github.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/blob/master/teams.md):

* **Conference A/V**
  * ThunderPlains 2018 videos have been uploaded to YouTube, but most of them don't have very many views yet. Please share!
  * Blixa will be running the A/V (streaming and/or recording) for 200OK 2019.
* **Content Marketing** - We will coordinate with the marketing committee for marketing our existing content and producing content for the purposes of marketing.
* **OKC A/V Automation** - We're looking into ways to automate and streamline processes for streaming at StarSpace46, with the hopes of getting more volunteers. Blixa has been working with the infrastructure committee on the [Twitch/Slack chatbot](https://github.com/techlahoma/infrastructure-committee/issues/1).
* **OKC A/V Hardware** - We are making plans to move forward with replacing audio mixer with a more powerful one that will give us clearer & louder audio. Before we make this purchase we are running tests to make sure this upgrade will provide us with the benefits we're expecting.
* **OKC A/V Volunteer Management** - Starting 4/1/2019, we will not stream meetups for groups that don't have trained volunteers available to run the streaming. The volunteers can be group leaders, but they don't have to be.
* **Norman Stream Team** 
  * Streaming: Not started yet. Streamline a setup that is easy to put up and take down (5-10 mins max) due to lack of dedicated streaming space. Don't want to stream on days when there are few attendees.  
  **Stretch goal**: 1 streamed talk per month (could be FCC Norman or other groups at the Innovation Hub). Streamed round table sessions using omnidirectional setting on mic e.g. Blue Yeti
  * Simulcasting: Setup and location has been streamlined, not too many attendees but may need a bigger space if more start to show up (currently can fit 4-6 people)
* **Tulsa Stream Team**
  * Streaming: Been running streams to individual usergroup Youtube accounts for about 1 year now.  The equipment doesn't currently have a permanent home, due to many usergroups using different locations (Web Devs and Game Devs use 36N, but TOSH can't operate hardware equipment there, so they locate at B&K Makerspace, Lambda Lunch is having to move to the library).
  * At this time, Project Make It owns and operates the equipment, with individual agreements with the usergroups.  The service and equipment is provided for free, in exhange for being allowed to post the brand logo among other sponsors.  Project Make It is open to expanding this agreement to Techlahoma directly, as well as other options.
  * Simulcasting: The existing equipment can handle display of, and transmission of, simulcast events, both via web services like Youtube and Twitch, and via direct RTMP streams.
* **Twitch Channel Management** - We're discussing ways to expand streaming and simulcasting to more locations, including Twitch hosting.
* **Twitch Highlighting** - Currently getting more volunteers up and going, and things are going well. **Could use more volunteers**
* **Workshop A/V** - We will create this team when the workshops program is ready for it.
* **YouTube Channel Management**
