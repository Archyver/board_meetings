# 2019-03-19 Content Creation Committee Report

The broadcasting committee has been renamed to Content Creation. We support Techlahoma's Conference, User Group, and Workshop programs by coordinating live streaming and video recording for events.

Report from each [team](https://github.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/blob/master/teams.md):

* Conference A/V - 
* OKC A/V Automation - 
* OKC A/V Hardware - 
* OKC A/V Volunteer Management - Starting 4/1/2019, we will not stream meetups for groups that don't have trained volunteers available to run the streaming. The volunteers can be group leaders, but they don't have to be.
* Norman Stream Team - 
  * Streaming: Not started yet. Streamline a setup that is easy to put up and take down (5-10 mins max) due to lack of dedicated streaming space. Don't want to stream on days when there are few attendees.  
  **Stretch goal**: 1 streamed talk per month (could be FCC Norman or other groups at the Innovation Hub). Streamed round table sessions using omnidirectional setting on mic e.g. Blue Yeti
  * Simulcasting: Setup and location has been streamlined, not too many attendees but may need a bigger space if more start to show up (currently can fit 4-6 people)
* Tulsa Stream Team - 
* Twitch Channel Management - 
* Twitch Highlighting - 
* Workshop A/V - We will create this team when the workshops program is ready for it.
* YouTube Channel Management -
