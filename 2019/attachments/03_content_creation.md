# 2019-03-19 Content Creation Committee Report

The broadcasting committee has been renamed to Content Creation. We support Techlahoma's Conference, User Group, and Workshop programs by coordinating live streaming and video recording for events.

Report from each [team](https://github.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/blob/master/teams.md):

* Conference A/V - 
* OKC A/V Automation - 
* OKC A/V Hardware - 
* OKC A/V Volunteer Management - Starting 4/1/2019, we will not stream meetups for groups that don't have trained volunteers available to run the streaming. The volunteers can be group leaders, but they don't have to be.
* Norman Stream Team - 
  * Streaming: Not started yet. Streamline a setup that is easy to put up and take down (5-10 mins max) due to lack of dedicated streaming space. Don't want to stream on days when there are few attendees.  
  **Stretch goal**: 1 streamed talk per month (could be FCC Norman or other groups at the Innovation Hub). Streamed round table sessions using omnidirectional setting on mic e.g. Blue Yeti
  * Simulcasting: Setup and location has been streamlined, not too many attendees but may need a bigger space if more start to show up (currently can fit 4-6 people)
* Tulsa Stream Team - 
  * Streaming: Been running streams to individual usergroup Youtube accounts for about 1 year now.  The equipment doesn't currently have a perminante home, due to many usergroups using different locations (Web Devs and Game Devs use 36N, but TOSH can't opperate hardware equipment there, so they locate at B&K Makerspace, Lambda Lunch is having to move to the library at this time)
    At this time, Project Make It owns and operates the equipment, with individual agreements with the usergroups.  The service and equipment is provided for free, in exhange for being allowed to post the brand logo among other sponsers.  Project Make It is open to expanding this agreement to Techlahoma directly, as well as other options.
  * Simulcasting: The existing equipment can handle display of, and transmission of, simulcast events, both via web services like Youtube and Twitch, and via direct RTMP streams.
* Twitch Channel Management - 
* Twitch Highlighting - 
* Workshop A/V - We will create this team when the workshops program is ready for it.
* YouTube Channel Management -
