# 2019-05-21 Content Creation Committee Report
## **Need more volunteers**

## Report from each [team/workgroup](https://github.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/blob/master/teams.md):

* Collaboration with Fundraising Committee
  * Fundraising committee will look into sponsorships for future A/V equipment purchases and using Twitch for fundraising
  * Checking with humblebundle.com for joining Techlahoma into their Partner Program with a registered entity rather than a single person -Kenneth-SC4L
* Collaboration with Membership Committee
  * Kimberly, Carlos, and Diana are meeting later this week to discuss how the two committees can work together.
* Conference and Workshop A/V
  * Blixa recorded the talks at 200 OK and will be uploading them to Techlahoma's YouTube channel.
  * Started a [checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1co_SbACmSKAn1bcVp_sVPmnBm7vtmGkXUtoLWshaP8o/edit) of our processes to provide to contractors/volunteers for conferences and workshops
* Content Marketing
  * Working on getting more YouTube subscribers
* OKC A/V Automation
  * James Deaton took initial steps to [generate the "script"](https://github.com/okjed/streamingschedulescript/blob/master/streamingtextstrings.Rmd) for OBS and Twitch fields and chat messages to [assist](https://okjed.shinyapps.io/streamingtextstrings/) streaming volunteers
  * Brandon Smith released the beginnings of a Twitch Video Manager app that currently helps identify videos needing to be highlighted (future goal to automate most of the twitch video management process including exporting to YouTube) - [Repo](https://github.com/techlahoma/twitch_video_manager) and [Heroku Demo](https://twitch-video-manager.herokuapp.com/).
* OKC A/V Hardware
  * Purchased and replaced lamp in right projector. Was able to get it for only
    $77 from reputable vendor ([Jaspertronics.com](https://www.jaspertronics.com/)), and lamp seems to be working well so far.
  * Completed audio testing in preparation for replacing mixer. OKC will be
    getting Techlahoma's mixer from Tulsa
    ([Behringer XR12](https://www.behringer.com//Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Digital/XR12/p/P0BI6))
    soon, which is currently not in use, so that saves us from having to
    purchase a new mixer.
  * Connected the TV on the back wall to a separate output on the streaming PC,
    so now we can control it separately via OBS. This allows us to place
    countdowns or messages to the presenter on that TV.
* OKC A/V Volunteer Management
  * Aaron is working on documenting the A/V volunteer management process for onboarding future team members, and training streaming members.
  * Actively establishing default streamers for OKC user groups, and defining a
    policy for training and managing streamers.
  * Need another volunteer, ideally.
* Project 3810 Streaming
  * Lawrence @CoLab Makerspace is setting up streaming at Proj.3810. Out of that effort there will be a portable stream kit that can be purchased for remote streaming at a price point sub. $1000. 
  * Targeting two use-cases: Meeting spaces that already have a projector and internet, where the meeting organizer uses a personally provided stream capable laptop (appropriate for meetings of 5-25 people); and for permanent installations, with multiple AV inputs at a reasonable price point (appropriate for 5-200 people)
* Twitch Channel Management
  * Kimberly signed up for Nightbot account to assist in announcements and moderation of Twitch Channel. Can add other users as Manager once they have linked their Twitch ID to Nightbot account and generate Nightbot userID.
  * Kenneth-SC4L entered a list of Commands for Nightbot to be used within Twitch Channel to streamline moderator announcements `!ask !github !help !list !meetup !prime !rq !slack !support !Techlahoma !ty !who !yt`
  * Kenneth-SC4L made subscriber (18px 36px 72px) icons for Twitch Channel, need testing with dark background and Pull Request accepted after passing check.
* Twitch Highlighting
  * Working on getting more volunteers involved and trained; staying on top of creating highlights
  * We would also like to work on creating Twitch clips for the purpose of marketing.
* YouTube Channel Management
  * Kimberly updated the YT videos in bulk to change from Gaming Category to Science & Technology Category. Exports from Twitch default to Gaming, so this will need to be done periodically.
