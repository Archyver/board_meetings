# 2019-05-21 Content Creation Committee Report
## **Need more volunteers**

## Report from each [team/workgroup](https://github.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/blob/master/teams.md):

* Collaboration with Fundraising Committee
  * Fundraising committee will look into sponsorships for future A/V equipment purchases and using Twitch for fundraising
  * Checking with humblebundle.com for joining Techlahoma into their Partner Program with a registered entity rather than a single person -Kenneth-SC4L
* Collaboration with Membership Committee
  * No interest from the membership committee yet
* Conference and Workshop A/V
  * Started a [checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1co_SbACmSKAn1bcVp_sVPmnBm7vtmGkXUtoLWshaP8o/edit) of our processes to provide to contractors/volunteers for conferences and workshops
* Content Marketing
* Norman Stream Team
* OKC A/V Automation
  * James Deaton took initial steps to [generate the "script"](https://github.com/okjed/streamingschedulescript/blob/master/streamingtextstrings.Rmd) for OBS and Twitch fields and chat messages to [assist](https://okjed.shinyapps.io/streamingtextstrings/) streaming volunteers
  * Brandon Smith released the beginnings of a Twitch Video Manager app that currently helps identify videos needing to be highlighted (future goal to automate most of the twitch video management process including exporting to YouTube) - [Repo](https://github.com/techlahoma/twitch_video_manager) and [Heroku Demo](https://twitch-video-manager.herokuapp.com/).  
**Currently looking into [Nightbot](https://www.nightbot.tv/) to see if that would be a better alternative.*
* OKC A/V Hardware
  * Purchased and replaced lamp in right projector. Was able to get it for only
    $77 from reputable vendor ([Jaspertronics.com](https://www.jaspertronics.com/)), and lamp seems to be working well so far.
  * Completed audio testing in preparation for replacing mixer. OKC will be
    getting Techlahoma's mixer from Tulsa
    ([Behringer XR12](https://www.behringer.com//Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Digital/XR12/p/P0BI6))
    soon, which is currently not in use, so that saves us from having to
    purchase a new mixer.
  * Connected the TV on the back wall to a separate output on the streaming PC,
    so now we can control it separately via OBS. This allows us to place
    countdowns or messages to the presenter on that TV.
* OKC A/V Volunteer Management
* OKC Stream Team
  * Kimberly signed up for Nightbot account to assist in announcements and moderation of Twitch Channel. Can add other users as Manager once they have linked their Twitch ID to Nightbot account and generate Nightbot userID.
