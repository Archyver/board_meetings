# 2019-05-21 Content Creation Committee Report
**Need more volunteers for the teams.**

Report from each [team/workgroup](https://github.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/blob/master/teams.md):

* Collaboration with Fundraising Committee
* Collaboration with Membership Committee
* Conference and Workshop A/V
* Content Marketing
* Norman Stream Team
* OKC A/V Automation - Initial steps taken to [generate the "script"](https://github.com/okjed/streamingschedulescript/blob/master/streamingtextstrings.Rmd) for OBS and Twitch fields and chat messages to [assist](https://okjed.shinyapps.io/streamingtextstrings/) streaming volunteers
* OKC A/V Hardware
  * Purchased and replaced lamp in right projector. Was able to get it for only
    $77 from reputable vendor ([Jaspertronics.com](https://www.jaspertronics.com/)), and lamp seems to be working well so far.
  * Completed audio testing in preparation for replacing mixer. OKC will be
    getting Techlahoma's mixer from Tulsa
    ([Behringer XR12](https://www.behringer.com//Categories/Behringer/Mixers/Digital/XR12/p/P0BI6))
    soon, which is currently not in use, so that saves us from having to
    purchase a new mixer.
  * Connected the TV on the back wall to a separate output on the streaming PC,
    so now we can control it separately via OBS. This allows us to place
    countdowns or messages to the presenter on that TV.
* OKC A/V Volunteer Management
* OKC Stream Team
* Project 3810 Streaming
