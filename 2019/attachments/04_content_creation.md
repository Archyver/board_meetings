# 2019-04-16 Content Creation Committee Report
**Need more volunteers for the teams.**

Report from each [team](https://github.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/blob/master/teams.md):

* Conference A/V - Blixa is good to go for 200OK 2019. Most [ThunderPlains 2018 videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdW0ayjzW_LBSUUJcIWePNq3zZMZwwmni) still have very few views.
* Content Marketing - Kristin has recorded a [member testimonial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7do7S-YuLDo), and we're planning more.
* Norman Stream Team - Haven't started streaming yet, but have the overlays ready. 3 new people have attended brown bag watch parties.
* OKC A/V Automation - Blixa got the chatbot working from Twitch to Slack and is working on the connection from Slack to Twitch.
* OKC A/V Hardware - Still working on doing due diligence for mixer upgrade (this may take a while). Planning on purchasing projector replacement lamps soon.
* OKC A/V Volunteer Management - Working on designating default streamer(s) for
  each user group. Currently we have designated the following committee members
  as liasons for specific user groups. It is the liason's responsibilities to
  handle streaming management for their respective groups:
  * Alex Adriaanse: OKC FP
  * Kimberly Collins: FreeCodeCamp, OKC OSH, OKC Python, OKC SQL, SheCodesOKC
  * Ryan Johnson: OKC Analytics, OKC Design+Tech, OKC#, Oklahoma Game Devs,
    ProductTankOKC
  * Aaron Krauss: DevopsOKC, OKC JUG, OKC Ruby, OKC.js, Big Data
  * All other OKC non-SS46 groups have not requested streaming.
* Twitch Channel Management - We have started asking members to record videos for us to stream to Twitch (outside of any particular user group) but haven't received any yet.
* Twitch Highlighting - Due to the number of new volunteers, we have set a new goal of highlighting within two weeks of the broadcast.
* YouTube Channel Management - We passed the 500 video mark and have increased from 800 to 870+ subscribers by asking for our Techlahoma slack members to subscribe. [Metrics](https://datastudio.google.com/reporting/1M0FYu5_G_BO8vaEoLHDVASdzifjk8hs0/page/JgD)
