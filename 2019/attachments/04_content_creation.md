# 2019-04-16 Content Creation Committee Report
**Could use more volunteers for the teams.**

Report from each [team](https://github.com/techlahoma/broadcasting/blob/master/teams.md):

* Conference A/V - Blixa is good to go for 200OK.
* Content Marketing
* Norman Stream Team - Haven't started streaming yet, but have the overlays ready. 3 new people have attended brown bag watch parties.
* OKC A/V Automation - Blixa got the chatbot working from Twitch to Slack and is working on the connection from Slack to Twitch.
* OKC A/V Hardware - Still working on doing due diligence for mixer upgrade (this may take a while). Planning on purchasing projector replacement lamps soon.
* OKC A/V Volunteer Management
* Twitch Channel Management - We have started asking members to record videos for us to stream to Twitch (outside of any particular user group) but haven't received any yet.
* Twitch Highlighting - Due to the number of new volunteers, we have set a new goal of highlighting within two weeks of the broadcast.
* YouTube Channel Management - We passed the 500 video mark and have increased from 800 to 840+ subscribers by asking for our Techlahoma slack members to subscribe.
